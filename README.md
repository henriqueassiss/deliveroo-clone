# Deliveroo Clone App

This is a Deliveroo app clone. Built for cross-platform in React Native.

The idea is to document a beatiful and open source example for beginners on how to build an responsive app in React Native.

I got inspired when I saw few documentation about responsive apps in React Native.

The beginners may be kind of confused, so here it is, a real example with some good practices.

[Here is my design inspiration](https://screenlane.com/screen/deliveroo-ios-app-653/).
